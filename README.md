# Captcha-Recognition-
The Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is a crucial human-machine distinguishing technique for websites to fend off automatic attacks from malicious software. Studies on CAPTCHA recognition have the potential to uncover security flaws, advance CAPTCHA technology, and even advance handwriting and license plate recognition. In order to recognize CAPTCHA and avoid using conventional image processing techniques like location and segmentation, this research suggested a solution based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The problem of over-fitting and local optimal solution has been resolved, and the adaptive learning rate is introduced to quicken the model's convergence. Using the multi task joint training model, model recognition accuracy and generalizability are enhanced.
